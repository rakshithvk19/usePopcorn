# LECTURE NOTES (Section 10)

- Criteria for splitting UI into components.

  1. Logical seperation of components i.e each component should have a proper layout and should be logically seperated.
  2. Reuseability.
  3. Complexity.

- Component categories

1. Stateless/presentational components.
2. Stateful components.
3. Structural components.

- PROP DRILLING: passing props through multiple components, becomes unnecessary and hard to maintain.

  - Solutions: 1.) Component Composition. -- combining different components using children props.
    - used in situations such as 1.) Creating highly reusable and flexible components. 2.) Fixing prop drilling.

- useEffect Hooks

  - dependency array
  - stale Closure

- whenever the initial value of useState() depends on some computation, the pass in a function as the parameter of the useState instead of calling the function as the parameter of useState()
- called LAZY EVALUATION
- has to be a pure function.

  - why?

- useRef() hook to manipulate DOM Elements.
- useRef() hook to persist data btw renders.

- customHooks() -- used when logic that contain hooks needs to be reused.
